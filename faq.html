<b>FAQ</b>: Frequently Asked Questions
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Q: What's your turn around time for a 100 photos from a catalog photo
shoot?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
That depends on the extent of the retouching needed and the current
jobs we have.  It's best to send a sample image and a description of
the project.
</dd>

<dt>Q: How much does it cost to repair my family photos?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
That depends on a variety of factors: (a) extent of damage
(b) number of photos (c) modifications needed (d) if the
originals are prints, slides, or already in digital form.
</dd>

<dt>Q: Do you provide scanning or printing services?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
Yes for simple scanning, but for professional scans and output I work
with several local services.  
</dd>

<dt>Q: How much do you charge for catalog work?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
$100.00/hr.  The time to retouch depends a great deal on the quality of the originals.

<dt>Q: How much does it cost to repair my family photos?</dt>

slides, or already in digital form. To restore an old damaged
photograph the minimum cost is $30.00/image.
</dd>

<dt>Q: Does your fee include shipping?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
No. The cost of shipping will vary depending on the project.
</dd>

<dt>Q: Do you provide scanning or printing services?</dt>
<dd id="answer">

with several local services.
</dd>

<dt>Q: How do I get started?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
First, I need to see the image to determine what needs to be done.
Email me a copy of the image (possibly a low-res proof version) with your
name, phone number, and attached email address.  Specify what would
you like done to the photo.  I will send back a quote. After you
approve the quote, send me the image, insured, along with your return
address.
</dd>

<dt>Q: How do I send my images?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
You can send them via email, a CD/DVD, SD/CF card, or the actual
photograph and I'll scan it (see photos below).  For email: the image
must be no larger than 5 MB.  Email images at jobs@photoretouchsf.com.
<p>
If you are sending large or multiple images, send them by mail on
CD/DVD (or most other media).  Scanned images must have a resolution
of at least <b>300dpi</b>.  Please make sure there is detail in the
whites and blacks.  Do not use any filters or color corrections.
Whether your photo is in color or black & white, scan it in RGB mode.
Save images as Tiff, Gif, Psd, or Jpeg (have quality set to high).  I
can retouch Raw files (usually Nef).
<p>
Be sure to let me know the type of output you'd like, meaning
electronic images on a DVD, or actual prints.  Indicate the border
desired and what kind of paper you would like (Matte or Glossy).
<p>
With all three ways of sending the images, it helps if you include the
name of the picture for easier identification, and communication
between you and I. Include your return address.
</dd>

<dt>Q: How do I send my photographs?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
For physical photographs: place photo in a protective sleeve and
center it between two pieces of cardboard (like a sandwich). Please
insure your photograph.
</dd>

<dt>Q: What happens after you receive the image/images?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
I will confirm that I have received your pictures with an email.  I
will also include a final bill which will include the cost of
shipping.  You will pay online by paypal.  I will then retouch your
image and send your restored photograph along with your original (it
will be insured) back to you (more about insurance below). Turn around
time depends on the size of the job.  Assume up to two weeks for a
damaged photograph that needs to be scanned, retouched, and sent back
to you.  For restored photographs, I will match the paper to the
original. E.g.: If the original photograph is glossy, I'll print it on
glossy paper, unless you request a different kind of paper.
</dd>

<dt>Q: Can i see a proof?</dt>
<dd id="answer">
I can send you an email of the proof. 
</dd>

<dt>Q: Tell me more about insurance</dt>
<dd id="answer">
Both UPS and FED EX insure packages up to $100.00.  If your photograph
is worth more, let me know so I can arrange the return to have more
coverage.
